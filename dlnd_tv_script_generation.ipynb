    "- **Hidden dim**: I set `hidden_dim = 256` to ensure that there were enough nodes/data for the final FC layer to predict the large number of possible word classes. \n",
    "- **Number of layers**: I set `num_layers = 2` as a deeper network is generally better. However, I did not increase it to 3 as I felt it might be too much for this task, and would also make the model much slower to train/increase the number of parameters.\n",
    "- **Model architecture**:\n",
    "    - Initially, I set **two** fully connected layers after the LSTM cells. However, I noticed that during training the model had problems converging, and trained very slowly. Thus, I decreased it to **1 fully connected layer** at the end.\n",
    "- **Training parameters**:\n",
    "    - I set a batch size of 32 (neither too big or too small)\n",
    "    - I initially set the learning rate to be `0.001`. For the first ~30 epochs this performed pretty well, helping to bring my loss under 4.0. However, after that my loss kept oscillating and decreasing very slowly.\n",
    "    - Thus, for the last 15 epochs I set learning rate to be `0.0005` (half the size) in case I had been taking too big steps. This helped to bring the loss under 3.5 quickly. "
