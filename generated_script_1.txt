kramer: you know, i thought i'd prefer a word better than a half- broadway.

george:(shocked) oh. oh my god.

jerry: i know, i have to be honest with you. i'm sorry. i'm sorry, you know, you know, we just got up together.

kramer:(entering jerry's apartment with his hips) oh no, no. you got me a note?

george: no, you know, it's very unusual. you gotta be careful.

george: what are you doing?

jerry: i thought i had to apologize for you.

jerry:(still trying to keep the pants down)

george: i don't believe this.(to himself) hey, hey! how'd you meet joe rifkin?

jerry: yeah.

george: well, i'm gonna need a ride.

george:(to george) you know i got the wrong news, i gotta drop dead.

george:(shocked) i don't think so.(pause) : what do ya' mean? you know what? i thought you said goodbye.

jerry:(smiling) well, maybe you'd prefer to get together, i got to go to india and get started, you know, we have to be alone.

elaine: hey, you know, i got the wrong news with him and he probably stopped crying from a golf star, maybe even a lot of people hitting me. you see, you think she'd have a good conversation...
